Android Clean & Testing Example
===============================

Here you have a full example project that shows how you can implement different tests types into your android projects. My goal with this repository is show the way to have a isolated architecture and how you can mock and test all the layers or components of the project.

You will can see next kind of tests.

* Unit Test
* Integration Test

By the way, also I want to show a full example about my personal approach of [Clean Architecture](https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).
